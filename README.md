# Rapilytics (Rap-e-lit-eks)

Research and build a POC psuedonimization technique to allow effective analytics as well as rapid and effective response to epidemic threats. Tools & Technology: Bloom Filters

Healthcare providers want to be able to share patientsâ€™ data with researchers, like the CDC, but need to comply with HIPAA and protect the patients privacy. Also when data is shared and if the researchers find something to help or heal the researched patients there would need to be a way to trace back to the patients. This FHIR application will take in a pseudonymization approach, in hopes of complying with HIPAA and be able to propagate life-saving findings back to the patients themselves.

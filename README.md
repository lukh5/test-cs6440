Research and build a POC psuedonimization technique to allow effective analytics as well as rapid and effective response to epidemic threats. Tools & Technology: Bloom Filters

Healthcare providers want to be able to share patientsâ€™ data to researchers but need to comply with HIPAA and protect the patients privacy. There is also a need to trace back to the patients if ultimately researchers find something to help or heal the researched patients. This FHIR application will take in a pseudonymization approach, in hopes of complying with HIPAA and be able to propagate life-saving findings to the patients themselves.
